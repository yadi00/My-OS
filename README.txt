(I) I used c++ Visual studio to complie this project. All parts of the assignment were completed. All the functions work properly.
(II) for the Snap shot function you may need to input it twice, however in most cases it ran once you put the S, and in some
cases i had to put S twice. 

(III) the instructions to run/complie the program are as follows :
(A) g++ main.cpp -std=c++11
(B) ./a.out
